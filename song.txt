I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason

Had to come and flip the script
Had a big bone to pick
Got the short end of sticks, so we made a fire with it
Let it burn to a crisp, now that's a sure fire flip
She's a boss, she's a bitch
I'll take that as a compliment
I see 'em moving real low, but leave 'em on a high note
Always lead with love
Mama raised me thorough
They better wake up, niggas on the way up
You ain't finna play her

Shawty gon' get that paper
Shawty tongue rip like razor
Shawty got wit, got flavor
Pardon my tits and make-up, uh, uh, pay her
Dribble then hit that lay up
Shawty ain't with them games, yeah
Shawty gon' get that paper, pay her

I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give, give me
