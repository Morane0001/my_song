I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason
I been trying not to go off the deep end
I don't think you wanna give me a reason

Had to come and flip the script
Had a big bone to pick
Got the short end of sticks, so we made a fire with it
Let it burn to a crisp, now that's a sure fire flip
She's a boss, she's a bitch
I'll take that as a compliment
I see 'em moving real low, but leave 'em on a high note
Always lead with love
Mama raised me thorough
They better wake up, niggas on the way up
You ain't finna play her
